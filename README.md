# ESILSolve - A python symbolic execution framework using r2 and ESIL

ESILSolve uses the z3 theorem prover and r2's ESIL intermediate representation to symbolically execute code. 

ESILSolve supports the same architectures as ESIL, including x86, amd64, arm, aarch64 and more. This project is a work in progress.
